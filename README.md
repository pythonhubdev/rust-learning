# Rust Learning

This repository contains the code I wrote while learning Rust. I am using the official Rust documentation for learning
Rust. I will be adding more code as I learn more about Rust. Any other sources I use will be mentioned in the README.md

## Resources

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Running the code

To run the code, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the instructions
on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

To run the code, navigate to the directory containing the code and run the following command:

```bash
rustc <filename>.rs
```

This will compile the code and create an executable file. To run the executable, run the following command:

```bash
./<filename>
```
